In this project, I am creating a phone book application with C++ language.While improving myself, 
I wanted my project to provide a small guide to people who have not done it before but want to do it in C++.
I used ddd (domain-driven-design) architecture in my project.On the domain side,
there are entity-factory-repository-service layers. 
Along with these layers, I also included the application and infrastructure layers.
I will write here the codes I created during this journey as I improved both myself and my project.
